    "For this problem, we will be analyzing emails taken from the [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/). Data is provided in the `enron` data directory, with one file per email. The data set includes a combination of \"spam\" and \"ham\" emails. Spam emails are unsolicited messages intended to sell a product or scam users into providing personal information, while ham emails represent everything that is not spam. \n",

    "The language used in spam emails tends to be considerably different from typical business emails. Most spam filters leverage this difference in word frequencies to detect spam as it arrives and filter it out of email inboxes. We will use Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to cluster the emails and attempt to identify groups of emails which are likely to be spam."

netsbestinfo homestead com nbi html dennis damorganjr yahoo com i reviewed site and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and i don t like mustard yellow for a background also in the second or third paragraph is a misspelled word which should be first come not as shown on the page i feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered on the site i will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter as has been mentioned many times some information about the person doing the page is always good we need some information about why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to dennis i took a look at your site and have recommendations for improving your page i use internet explorer and view web pages with my text size set to smaller the text you used was quite large like a font used for a heading for all the text by making the text size smaller it wouldn t feel like you were screaming at me also the background was just too much there were spelling errors in the text often it might be difficult for you to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time but have a friend look it over spelling errors make the page look unprofessional offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like before they subscribe also if you are asking for a person to give you their email address you must have a privacy policy and let them know they can unsubscribe think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter it looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to offer information about yourself and the kinds of information your newsletter contains maybe extend your site to include back issues or an archive to see what information you have offered in the past build another page for sponsoring info and put prices on that page remove all pricing information from the home page i feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text i also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read quickly and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily i noticed some spelling errors and i think that a link to the classifieds site should be provided and online payments should be accepted a site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it this is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the message i did not like the background colour however that is personal it did not detract from the information i was tempted to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see a current issue there was an error in the wording a word missed which needs correction and i think the fonts could be smaller overall a non confusing site which makes a nice change cheers could use a better background and the fonts are very large there also are errors in the following paragraphs first com first serve and to place a sponsor advertisement send your to my email a single page site it is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster s newsletter to see what he s doing and it doesn t seem to me to be a way to get people to visit i wouldn t for example he claims to have lots of tidbits of information that he says we probably didn t know and this is possible but in my opinion he would be better served if he at least put some of the things out there for all to see when the appetite so to speak if he want people to subscribe as it is i would not bother what does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo some useful resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy advertisement on the net but what we get here is a newsletter with the owner whose email reads damorgarjr yahoo com asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free line ad he also tells of paid category of advertisements this is all we get from a site which has a grand title even the information about the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about to points size which gets difficult to read a neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on the eyes there is only really one problem with this page its just an advertisement for a newsletter no scratch that its an advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter a bold enough move perhaps but i learned hardly anything about the newsletter itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of ads to my email account so i didn t even subscribe presumably you d want to get people to sign up so might i suggest splitting the page into the newsletter itself perhaps a sample issue a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click for more info on your free ads vote on your favorite website design help out the winner of the free website

is grandma or your next door neighbor or your cat write your sales letter just like you are writing it to them personally why because when your potential customer reads it then it will seem personal almost like you wrote it with them in mind too often sales letters are written as if they were going to be read to an audience rather than one person keep your sales letters personal because one person at a time is going to read them use an illustration to get your point across in my sales letters i have told stories about my car stalling on the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we

you are trying to make emphasize a benefit by sharing an account from the real world it effectively creates interest and further establishes the point create an interest in the reader from the very first line your first line of the sales letter should immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know more go back to the beginning of this article the first words were it s true i can guarantee you that either consciously or subconsciously you thought what s true immediately your mind wanted to know what i was talking about before you even knew it you were right here paragraphs into this article carefully craft your first line if you can immediately get them wanting to know more you ve got a winner use bullets people spend a lot of time reading bulleted lists in fact they often reread them over and over use bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or service to spell out exactly what is included in your offer use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight each line and create a sense of more length to the list launch into a bullet list immediately shortly after your opening line immediately give the reader a bullet list of benefits to absorb hit them with your best shot pull out the big guns and stress just a few of the most important things the reader will discover by offering a killer list early in your sales letter you will automatically create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad copy after all if they are already interested after the first list of benefits they will certainly be open to finding out even more reasons why your product or service will aid them just let it all flow out write down everything that enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter you can edit it later if you just sit and start writing everything you know about your product or service and how it will benefit your customer you will be amazed at how much information floods your mind write it all down then read through it you ll be able to add a lot more detail to many of the points edit it after you have exhausted all of your ideas make your sales letter personal make sure that the words you and your are at least over i and my your ad copy must be written about your customer not yourself i m not sure how the old advertising adage goes but it s something like this i don t care a thing about your lawn mower i just care about my lawn leads aren t interested in you or your products they are interested in themselves and their wants and needs when you are finished with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test webpage run a check at http www keywordcount com and see what the ratio between you and your versus references to i me my etc it s a free service make sure it s at least in favor of the customer write like you speak forget all of those rules that your grammar teacher taught you write your sales letters in everyday language just like you would talk in person don t be afraid to begin sentences with and or because don t worry about ending a sentence with a preposition write like you speak your sales letter isn t the great american novel so don t write it like you are ernest hemingway use short paragraphs consisting of sentences each long copy works but long paragraphs do not use short paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph don t be afraid to use short sentences like this one or this see what i mean shorter paragraphs keep the interest of the reader longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often force the reader to get distracted stress the benefits not the features again readers want the burning question answered what s in it for me what need is it going to meet what want is it going to fill how is your product or service going to be of value or benefit to the reader spell it out don t focus on the features of your product or service but rather how those features will add value to the life of your reader for example if you are selling automobile tires you may very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world but who cares i don t care about your selection but i do care about keeping my month old baby girl safe while we are traveling so instead of focusing on your selection you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe because you have a tire that will fit my car you re not selling tires you re selling safety for my family stress the benefits not the features keep the reader interested some sales letters read like they are a manual trying to explain to me how i can perform some complicated surgery on my wife they are filled with words and phrases that i need a dictionary to understand unless you are writing to a very targeted audience avoid using technical language that many readers might not understand keep it simple using words language and information that are easy to understand and follow target your sales letter when you are finished with your final draft of the sales letter target it to a specific audience for example if you are selling a work at home product then rewrite the sales letter by adding words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards women who are homemakers then rewrite the same sales letter and target it to college students write another letter targeting senior citizens still another could be written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income during summer vacation the possibilities are endless all you need to do is add a few words here and there in your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service is specifically designed for a target audience work only hours a week would become college students work only hours a week your sales letter is now targeted upload all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website you could easily target s of groups then simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted mediums you could advertise the college students page in a campus ezine the senior citizens page could be advertised at a retirement community message board by creating these targeted sales letters you can literally open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product to and in their eyes it looks like the product was a match made for them make your ad copy easy to follow use short sentences and paragraphs break up the sales letter with attention grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph one thing that i have always found to work very well in sales letters is to use a pause like this start the sentence on one line leaving the reader wanting to know more and then finishing up on the next line also if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on several different pages of your website use a catchy hook line at the end of each page to keep them clicking let s get you started down the road to success shall we click here to continue use similes and metaphors for effect when the customer purchases your product they will generate a flood of traffic that would make noah start building another ark if they do not order today then they will feel like a cat that let the mouse get away use words to create a picture in the readers mind when you think of superman what comes to mind immediately we remember that he is faster than a speeding bullet more powerful than a locomotive able to leap tall buildings in a single bound see how word pictures stick in our minds focus on one product or service don t try to sell your customer multiple products at the same time it only confuses the reader keep your ad copy directed at one specific product or service then use other products and services as back end products make it stand out don t kid yourself there are hundreds maybe thousands out there on the web doing the same thing you are doing how will you stand out among the crowd your sales letter must inject personality it must breathe of originality your product or service is different it s not like all of the rest it is unique right your sales letter must separate you from the competition it must create a feeling of you won t find this anywhere else be believable earn in the next hours delete good grief do they think i am an idiot or something get real don t make outrageous claims that are obviously not the truth you ll ruin your reputation let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be reversed once you have been branded a liar you will never be anything but a liar it doesn t matter if you launch the most respectable honest business available anywhere people will always have doubt because they remember the crazy stuff you ve said before be believable don t exaggerate mislead stretch or distort the truth be specific don t generalize your information but rather be exact instead of over tips for losing weight use tips for losing weight by generalizing information it creates doubt and questions in the reader s mind what am i really getting here does he even know when you use specific information the reader begins to think this person must have counted i know exactly what i can expect platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water from a duck wrote claude hopkins in his classic book scientific advertising they leave no impression whatsoever be complete tell the reader everything they would want to know about your product or service answer all of their questions anything they would want to consider before making a purchase think about it from their point of view ask yourself why wouldn t i buy this then address that in your sales letter remove anything that would keep the reader from making the purchase use testimonials to boost your sales share actual excerpts from what your current customers are saying about your product or service many websites have an entire section or even a separate page that has endorsements and compliments listed satisfied customers remove some of the doubt in the mind of the reader if these people have found a lot of value and benefit in the product then i probably will too especially effective are testimonials from respected well known authorities within your target field use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter a headline isn t just relegated to the beginning of your ad copy use them frequently but don t overuse a well placed headline re grabs the reader s attention brings them deeper into the letter and readies them for the next paragraph you will want to spend as much time working on your headlines as you do the entire sales letter they are that important avoid asking stupid questions wouldn t you like to make a year doesn t that sound great would you like to be as successful as i am avoid any question that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them feel like they are inferior offer a freebie even if the customer doesn t buy if the customer decides he or she isn t going to make a purchase then you want to follow up with them later to try to influence them to buy in the future by offering a free item you can request their email address in order to obtain the freebie by doing this you can now follow up with the customer for a potential future sale additionally you can continue the sales process by having your ad copy banners flyers etc within the free item and of course if your free item is a high quality useful product or service which impresses the customer they probably will be back as a customer soon use bonuses to overwhelm the reader one of the things that i have found very effective in writing sales letters is to include bonus items that out value the actual product i am offering ginsu made this one famous they were selling a set of steak knives but before the commercial was finished you had so many bonus items on the table it was hard to refuse make sure you provide quality bonuses and not some worthless outdated junk that damages the credibility of your main offer use connective phrases like but wait there s more and but that s not all these phrases effectively lead the reader from one paragraph to the next particularly when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits or leads into bonus items again the idea is more and more value and benefits to the reader always include a deadline by including a deadline you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer if i don t order within hours then i won t get the bonuses oh no there are only items remaining i ve got to hurry let the customer know what they will be missing out on if they don t make the deadline remember they won t miss out on your products or bonuses they will miss out on all of the benefits of your products deadlines are very effective every sales letter should have one tell them exactly how to order be clear as to the order process point them towards the order link tell them what methods you offer i e credit cards checks etc make this process as simple and clear as can be if it takes more than steps most people won t continue explain when the product will be delivered how quickly will the order be processed when will the order be available let the customer know exactly what they can expect when they place their order the more specific you can be here the better let them know that you have a system in place operators are standing by their order will be handled properly tell them offer a money back guarantee take away their last reason to hold back offer a no questions asked day guarantee most people may not realize this but in most cases it s the law of the land you are required to give them their money back if they are not satisfied with the product or service since it s the law anyway why not make it a benefit let them know that they are purchasing your product or service risk free instruct them to respond immediately many people just need to read those words act now order today click here to instantly place your order you ve got them this far now tell them what you want them to do get them to act fast have you ever heard a mail order commercial on television that didn t prompt the viewer to order right way include a post script people will always read the p s always in fact the p s is one of the most important parts of your

seventhpower com internet success through simplicity every day of the week i get questions from people all over the world including my no bs gimg members wanting to know some of the most valuable secrets to my on going internet success let me say above all else i don t believe there are any true secrets to success on the net what you do to become successful in the online world is not a secret in my opinion most successful people follow simple clear repeatedly proven strategies to succeed whether on the net or off but when it comes to someone asking for advice consultation or simply asking what s your secret i have to blush say persistence and personality of course i always follow the advice with my own little disclaimer what makes me successful may not work the same for you your first lesson is to get over the deep seeded idea that success of any kind in my opinion is somehow an unknown unattainable secret clearly it is not it s not unknown it s not unattainable it s not years of digging to find the secrets to internet riches one thing that gets to me so often in my work as an internet consultant author and internet success strategist is that so many people on the net seem to have this incredibly huge mental block that stands between themselves and success on the net it s almost as if they ve been barraged by so many claims of what works and what doesn t work and so many long complicated routes to actually succeeding in their online venture that success is the equivelant of a foot high brick wall it s not that difficult my friends it is not that complicated long time friend and business associate rick beneteau has a new ebook out called branding you breaking the bank get it http www roibot com bybb cgi im bybtb but the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your online venture a success and yes rick i come from the same school of self marketing marketing you obviously that s the core of his excellent new ebook and i couldn t agree with him more point being you are everything you do online to succeed you are your web site your business your marketing piece your customer service your customers experiences with your business all of it is you read his ebook you ll see more of what i m saying the matter at hand is that brick wall you might have standing high as you can see blocking the path between you internet success listen to me it is not real ok it doesn t exist there s nothing there to fear to begin with get over it what i m telling you is the only thing standing between you and the success you most desire is yourself when you realize this you will tear down that brick wall by means of complete and instantaneous disintegration it will no longer exist in your mind which is the only real place it ever was anyhow yes persistence and personality inherently includes honesty integrity accountability and many other qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate goals and realize that probably the most valuable powerful key to your success is you that may be the most incredible secret we ever uncover in our lifetime and trust me that brick wall won t ever get in your way again unless you let it talk about simple bryan is a veteran internet consultant author internet success strategist marketer he publishes mega success com chronicles to over

http www be your own isp com http www seventhpower com ways to create a unique website internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical design this is often because webmasters do not have the ability or time to design and create unique websites these five points will help you come up with a one of a kind design for your website navigation system deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first things to consider when designing your website visitors usually look for a way to get to the information they want before reading anything else i would suggest putting your navigation system in two areas look at webmasterbase http www webmasterbase com for example there is a list of categories on the left and information about the network on the top bar it is not recommended that you place your navigation at the bottom of the page because people see the top of the page first if you have a lot of content on one page the navigation gets pushed to bottom of the page away from the visitor color scheme when you are choosing colors make sure they contrast for example do not use bright green and florescent pink some colors that are often used are white on black or black on white a wonderful utility that is web based and free is color schemer http www godigitalstudios com www color created by aaron epstein many other programs exist that can assist you in choosing colors try doing a search on freewarefiles http www freewarefiles com tucows http www tucows com or download com http www download com for color schemer content window this is the brain of the website make sure that the text here is easy to read and understand also provide your own original content people do not want to hear what somebody else has to say they want to hear what you want to say while it might be time consuming to write your own content it sure is worth it to find content for your website try searching at ezinearticles http www ezinearticles com other people may have used the articles but if you become good friends with the authors they may send you new content as they write it be careful though do not use too much content from other authors as mentioned above font s several types of fonts exist the first one i will discuss is fixed width or monospace similar to courier or courier new fixed width fonts are good for displaying code like html another type of font is called sans serif it is similar to arial windows or helvetica macintosh this font can be used for long pieces of text the final type of font is called serif because it has serifs or curves in each letter often this font is called times windows or georgia macintosh this font like sans serif is often used for long blocks of text it is preferred because its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter making it easier to read advertising ah everybody s favorite advertising this is one of thing that almost every website has the most common type is what is known as banner advertising it is called that because it is long and thin like a paper banner how long you ask the generic kind is pixels wide by pixels high new sizes however are being used take for example the new style called skyscraper so called for a reason it looks like a skyscraper it is tall about pixels but not too wide about pixels finding a way to place advertising can be tricky banners used to be placed and still are only at the top of the page nevertheless banners are starting to be placed in the middle of the page at the bottom or along the side conclusion these are only five things to consider when

solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds the source of this funds is as follows between and this committee awarded contracts to various contractors for engineering procurement supply of electrical equipments such as transformers and some rural electrification projects however these contracts were over invoiced by the committee thereby leaving the sum of us million dollars eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars in excess this was done with the intention that the committee will share the excess when the payments are approved the federal government have since approved the total contract sum which has been paid out to the companies and contractors concerned which executed the contracts leaving the balance of m dollars which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe off shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst ourselves we need your assistance as the funds are presently secured in an escrow account of the

really can make people money this is what one had to say thanks to this profitable opportunity i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required to my astonishment i received a figure income in weeks with money still coming in pam hedland fort lee new jersey here is another testimonial this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my on it i followed the simple instructions and walaa weeks later the money started to come in first month i only made a small amount of money but the next months after that i made a total of a good figures so far in the past

primary methods to get this venture going method sending bulk e mail legally let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only e mails each let s also assume that the mailing receive only a response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only also many people may send out hundreds of thousands e mails instead of only each continuing with this example you send out only e mails with a response that is only orders for report those people responded by sending out e mail each for a total of out of those e mails only responded with orders that s people responded and ordered report those people mail out e mails each for a total of e mails the response to that is orders for report those people send out e mails each for a total of million e mails sent out the response to that is orders for report those people send out e mails each for a total of million emails the response to that is orders for report that s orders times each a half million your total income in this example is grand total numbers do not lie get a pencil paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it you can still make money remember friend this is assuming only people ordering out of people you mailed dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or or even one of those people mailed e mails each or more there are over million people on the internet worldwide and counting believe me many people may do just that and more method placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet can easily get a larger response we strongly suggest you start with method and add

days later she jumped in with both feet i made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old i told you so on her when the thing didn t work well the laugh was on me within weeks she had received

to make up my mind to participate in this plan but conservative that i am i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn t get enough orders to at least get my money back i was surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders i made a large figure income in the first weeks the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live there simply isn t a better investment with a faster return and so big dan sondstrom alberta canada i had received this program before i deleted it but later i wondered if i should have given it a try of course i had no idea who to contact to get another copy so i had to wait until i was e mailed again by someone else months passed then it luckily came again i did not delete this one i made a six figure income on my first try and all the money came within weeks susan de suza new york n y it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little

confidentiality in this transaction this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day we have decided to contact you first by your email due to the urgency of this transaction as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you so we decided it is best using the email let me start by first introducing myself properly to you i am dr kaku opa a director general in the ministry of mines and power and i head a three man tender board appointed by the government of the federal republic of nigeria to award contracts to individuals and companies and to approve such contract payments in the ministry of mines and power the duties of the committee also include evaluation vetting and monitoring of work done by foreign and local contractors in the ministry i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence in order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds the source of this funds is as follows between and this committee awarded contracts to various contractors for engineering procurement supply of electrical equipments such as transformers and some rural electrification projects however these contracts were over invoiced by the committee thereby leaving the sum of us million dollars eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars in excess this was done with the intention that the committee will share the excess when the payments are approved the federal government have since approved the total contract sum which has been paid out to the companies and contractors concerned which executed the contracts leaving the balance of m dollars which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe off shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst ourselves we need your assistance as the funds are presently secured in an escrow account of the federal government specifically set aside for the settlement of outstanding payments to foreign contractors we are handicapped in the circumstances as the civil service code of conduct does not allow us to operate off shore accounts hence your importance in the whole transaction my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf you or your company will retain of the total amount of us eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars while will be for us members of this panel and the remaining will be used in offsetting all debts expenses incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer needless to say the trust

       " 'subject re trading support operations london fernley on january i had breakfast in london with a shaking richard sage who recounted the tail of barry threatening his bonus and employment for doing exactly what jeff skilling told him to do in the previous november subsequently richard was moved from his position and barry promoted if that is dealing with the situation this actually reflects on your credibility if you think that an open communication independent back office message was sent to the back and middle office in houston and london by virtue of your promotion of barry twice in months then you are sorely mistaken on february the arthur andersen team including tom bauer john sorrells and jim brown stated that barry was an issue in satisfactorily completing the audit tasks from london i am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here you have dismissed my advice and you need to do what you need to do if the goal is to get me to change my view you have a big hole to dig out of i obviously can t change your point of view i still feel a responsiblity to express the views that i have and others are afraid to surface it is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere need i go on let us stop the e mail wars now they serve no productive purpose ted fernley dyson am to ted murphy hou ect ect cc rick buy hou ect ect sally beck hou ect ect richard causey corp enron enron subject re trading support operations london ted we have had discussions about barry in the past and i have followed up on specific instances you have mentioned i believe they date back to and prior to my first hand experience of working with barry throughout and the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has changed since then we are not so barry dependent we have a team of quality risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary recruiting ground for the rac team david port oliver gaylard barry s role is much less hands on now and he is not our candidate for the global products position this will continue to be kevin sweeney the role i suggest for barry is the high level co ordination of the operations team his energy enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan combined with his considerable institutional knowledge making a superior candidate difficult to find frankly i suggested steve young not for additional depth but to address the relationship issue that clearly exists i do not belittle this issue and while i don t think that anyone can point to any prosecutable offences that barry may have committed in recent history his management style doesn t help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and objective i will say that he has always been open and frank very frank with me indeed if mally and sweeney had been as open we may have had a different story to tell on helsinki as an aside i have not been involved in or consulted on the world tour although i know that barry suggested this sort of thing to sally a few weeks back i think it is great that brent price is involved but we would be happy to contribute staff to this too regards fernley to fernley dyson lon ect ect cc rick buy sally beck hou ect ect subject re trading support operations london fernley as we discussed earlier this year i have serious concerns about barry that i think are both well founded and reasonably well documented to be fair i will say that since ql of last year i have not seen any further prosecutable offenses and he has made some attempts at being more communicative however i am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his transformation particulary with as influential person as john sherriff in charge of the office probably more to the point it continues to concern me that london has not developed an operations team that is not so barry dependent evidence to this effect are the fact that he is your only candidate for the global products position that someone from houston has to be part of the world tour in europe brent price that your candidates for a senior interim operations head in helsinki was david port or richard sage and that your suggestion for additional depth is steve young further for the record i believe that i am not the only one with whom barry has a credibility issue arthur andersen other global products personnell and other risk people in london have expressed similar concerns to me i just happen to be the most vocal ted fernley dyson pm to richard causey corp enron enron cc rick buy hou ect ect john sherriff lon ect ect ted murphy hou ect ect sally beck hou ect ect subject trading support operations london rick not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support function particularly as it relates to our global products business we already have barry pearce taking a lead in this area the issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more permanent solution well nothing is permanent in enron and i think barry understands this as well as anybody if we had a more suitable candidate we would give him her the job i have seen barry develop and mature over the last months along with the team that we have built around him i m convinced that he can add significant value by drawing the global products support functions in to the fold however he clearly has a credibility issue with ted in particular and whilst i do not share ted s views i do not hold barry out as a saint and i can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded i suggest that we continue to search for a candidate known and trusted within houston who can instill confidence there steve young head of rac in london may be an interesting option although i m sure he would not be easy to replace in the meantime we need barry to take things forward and i will be monitoring the situation very closely regards fernley',\n",

proportions right now in the united states there is between and billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt for every judgment that is paid more judgments take its place we identified this massive market years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since we invented this business we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments the income potential is substantial in this profession we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making to over per year part time associates are earning between and per year some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves others build a sizable organization of to people in attractive business offices today our company and our associates have over million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing of this million million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates joint ventures are where we make our money we only break even when our course is purchased we make a margin on the reports we supply to our associates our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies police officers attorneys credit agencies etc all come to us for reports many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between million to over million dollars legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off the norm is interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments annual interest on million at translates to annually in interest income not counting the payment of the principal our associates earn half of this amount or per year this is just for interest not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income typically companies are sold for times earnings just based on simple interest an associate with million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately million dollars of all of our associates work out of their home are women and are part time one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go the judgments you are working on will be there when you return the judgments are still in force they do not disappear the way we train you is non confrontational you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing you never confront the debtor the debtor doesn t know who you are you are not a collection agency simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments we train you how to find out who to write to to of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help they call you you don t call them unless you want to you send them an agreement supplied in the course to sign which splits every dollar you collect to you and to them this applies no matter if the judgment is for or you then go on line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets we offer over powerful reports to assist you they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus to bank account locates employment locates skip traces and locating stocks and bonds etc the prices of our reports are very low typically to of what other firms charge for example we charge for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course when you receive the assets you keep and send to the original judgment holder once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court included in

       " 'subject re trading support operations london i agree fully with the last sentence e mail is not an appropriate forum to discuss an issue like this this may be somewhat moot given fernley s latest e mail but i believe this warrants direct communication fernley i would suggest you set up a discussion that would include this group and may grow to include aa at some point to get their perspective directly as i have indicated before i believe barry is a valuable asset but may need some more managing ted murphy ect pm to fernley dyson lon ect ect cc rick buy hou ect ect sally beck hou ect ect richard causey corp enron enron subject re trading support operations london fernley on january i had breakfast in london with a shaking richard sage who recounted the tail of barry threatening his bonus and employment for doing exactly what jeff skilling told him to do in the previous november subsequently richard was moved from his position and barry promoted if that is dealing with the situation this actually reflects on your credibility if you think that an open communication independent back office message was sent to the back and middle office in houston and london by virtue of your promotion of barry twice in months then you are sorely mistaken on february the arthur andersen team including tom bauer john sorrells and jim brown stated that barry was an issue in satisfactorily completing the audit tasks from london i am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here you have dismissed my advice and you need to do what you need to do if the goal is to get me to change my view you have a big hole to dig out of i obviously can t change your point of view i still feel a responsiblity to express the views that i have and others are afraid to surface it is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere need i go on let us stop the e mail wars now they serve no productive purpose ted fernley dyson am to ted murphy hou ect ect cc rick buy hou ect ect sally beck hou ect ect richard causey corp enron enron subject re trading support operations london ted we have had discussions about barry in the past and i have followed up on specific instances you have mentioned i believe they date back to and prior to my first hand experience of working with barry throughout and the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has changed since then we are not so barry dependent we have a team of quality risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary recruiting ground for the rac team david port oliver gaylard barry s role is much less hands on now and he is not our candidate for the global products position this will continue to be kevin sweeney the role i suggest for barry is the high level co ordination of the operations team his energy enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan combined with his considerable institutional knowledge making a superior candidate difficult to find frankly i suggested steve young not for additional depth but to address the relationship issue that clearly exists i do not belittle this issue and while i don t think that anyone can point to any prosecutable offences that barry may have committed in recent history his management style doesn t help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and objective i will say that he has always been open and frank very frank with me indeed if mally and sweeney had been as open we may have had a different story to tell on helsinki as an aside i have not been involved in or consulted on the world tour although i know that barry suggested this sort of thing to sally a few weeks back i think it is great that brent price is involved but we would be happy to contribute staff to this too regards fernley to fernley dyson lon ect ect cc rick buy sally beck hou ect ect subject re trading support operations london fernley as we discussed earlier this year i have serious concerns about barry that i think are both well founded and reasonably well documented to be fair i will say that since ql of last year i have not seen any further prosecutable offenses and he has made some attempts at being more communicative however i am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his transformation particulary with as influential person as john sherriff in charge of the office probably more to the point it continues to concern me that london has not developed an operations team that is not so barry dependent evidence to this effect are the fact that he is your only candidate for the global products position that someone from houston has to be part of the world tour in europe brent price that your candidates for a senior interim operations head in helsinki was david port or richard sage and that your suggestion for additional depth is steve young further for the record i believe that i am not the only one with whom barry has a credibility issue arthur andersen other global products personnell and other risk people in london have expressed similar concerns to me i just happen to be the most vocal ted fernley dyson pm to richard causey corp enron enron cc rick buy hou ect ect john sherriff lon ect ect ted murphy hou ect ect sally beck hou ect ect subject trading support operations london rick not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support function particularly as it relates to our global products business we already have barry pearce taking a lead in this area the issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more permanent solution well nothing is permanent in enron and i think barry understands this as well as anybody if we had a more suitable candidate we would give him her the job i have seen barry develop and mature over the last months along with the team that we have built around him i m convinced that he can add significant value by drawing the global products support functions in to the fold however he clearly has a credibility issue with ted in particular and whilst i do not share ted s views i do not hold barry out as a saint and i can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded i suggest that we continue to search for a candidate known and trusted within houston who can instill confidence there steve young head of rac in london may be an interesting option although i m sure he would not be easy to replace in the meantime we need barry to take things forward and i will be monitoring the situation very closely regards fernley',\n",

likely have seen or heard about the letter paypal program that has been seen lately on and oprah winfrey etc how would you like to generate more income through a different avenue what if it took only an hour to set it up even if you are already in another program stay with it but do yourself a favor and do this one as well there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business the facts are simple if you need to make a few thousand dollars really fast then this program i m going to share with you is the way to do it it s the fastest easiest program you will ever do here s something which i trust will be of interest to you please read all of this this is not something that i would normally look at except that i read an article in the wall street journal on about paypal and when i came across this concept i knew it would work because as a member of pay pal i had already experienced their efficiency and good standing you can complete this whole process in one hour and you will never forget the day you decided to do so oh did i say fast by fast i mean the speed of the internet type fast everything is done on the internet by e mail need proof here are just two testimonials from individuals who decided to invest nothing more than a little of their time testimonials from tony stevens vandenberg afb ca hey i got your e mail you rock i sent it to all of our frat brothers and while i haven t seen my grand yet i m up to hook me up when you run this program again mary gathers columbia sc hey cuz this is mary i only have one thing to say to you oh my god i sent e mail s out like you said and went on vacation when i got back my account was up to over i owe you getting started if you re not already a user the very first thing you need to do is go to paypal and sign up it takes two minutes and paypal will deposit in your account that makes this program free here s the link be sure to sign up for a premier free account or you ll be limited to dollars only you will make much more than this then e mail from your paypal account free to the first name on the list no along with a little note like please add me to your mailing list be prepared to get excited you won t be disappointed don t laugh try this while you wait for the others to start working one hour of work to get started no mailing lists no printing copying or waiting and the concept is legal refer to us postal and lottery laws title section and or title section in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume sections and which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received here s how it works unlike many other programs this three level program is more realistic and much much faster because it is so easy the response rate is very high very fast internet e mail fast and you will see results in just two weeks or less just in time for next months bills you need only mail out copies not or more as in other programs ideally you should send them to people who send their programs to you or to personal contacts who are already working on the web because they know these programs work and they are already believers in the system besides this program is much much faster and has a higher response rate even if you are already in another program stay with it but do yourself a favor and do this one as well start right now it s simple and will only cost max it will pay off long before others even begin to receive letters just give one person a gift remember though this is the you get when you sign up for your new paypal account that s all if you already have a paypal account and do not receive the feel free to donate a gift to the person in the no spot and add your name on the list at no position having moved up the remaining two follow the simple instructions and in two weeks you will have in your bank account because of the virtually zero investment speed and high profit potential this program has a very high response rate all from just one transaction that you get from paypal follow these simple instructions e mail the from your paypal account to the first name on the list no along with a note saying subscribe me to your mailing list only the first person on the list gets your name and gift edit the list removing the first no name from the list move the other two names up and add your name don t try to add your name in the first place in order to earn money fast if you do that you will only reach people you send e mail to then your name will be immediately removed from the no place and you can t reach more people but if you add your name on the no place there will be tons of people receiving e mail s later and when your name is no note do not forget to replace the paypal referring url in the body of the letter with your own paypal referring url send out copies minimum of this letter also note by sending this letter and the payment via e mail the response time is much faster electronic transfer internet fast consider this millions of people surf the internet everyday all day all over the world here are the people to start with sign up send to the first person move the other two up to nos there s nothing more to do when your name reaches the first position in a few days it will be your turn to collect your money the money will be sent to you by to people like yourself who are willing to invest one hour to receive in cash that s all there will be a total of in bills in your mailbox account in two weeks for one hour s work this is real money that you can spend on anything you wish just deposit it to your own bank account or spend it directly from your paypal account it s just that easy i think it s worth it don t you go ahead try it even if you make just or thousand wouldn t that be nice if you try it it will pay can you do it again of course you can this plan is structured for everyone to send only letters each however you are certainly not limited to mail out as many as you want every letters you send has a return of or more if you can e mail forty sixty eighty or whatever go for it the more you put into it the more you get out of it each time you run this program just follow steps through and everyone on your gift list benefits simple enough you bet it is besides there are no mailing lists to buy and wait for and trips to the printer or copier and you can do it again and again with your regular groups or gift givers or start up a new group be sure and pay the first person on the list this is proof that you paid to get put on the list which is the service rendered to make all this legal why not it s working each time you receive an mlm offer respond with this letter your name will climb to the number one position at dizzying rates follow the simple instructions and above all please play fair that s the key to this program s success your name must run the full gamut on the list to produce the end results sneaking your name higher up on the list will not produce the results you think and it only cheats the other people who have worked hard and have earned the right to be there so please play by the rules and the will come to you e mail your letters out today together we will prosper you are probably skeptical of this especially with all the different programs out there on the web but if you don t try this you will never know that s the way i felt i m glad i did it i ve been watching this type of program for years and this is about as easy and fast as you can get it and it can even be free to try now with pay pal no stamps no envelopes no copies to be made just a little effort and faith this program really keeps it short and simple oh by the way each time someone signs up with your link under your name you also make from paypal so they pay to open up the account but they also pay you when someone signs up from being referred by you awesome let s all make some serious money click here to begin play by the rules this doesn t cost anything but your time and if everyone plays fair everyone wins following are some notes about paypal which you may find helpful paypal lets you pay anyone with an e mail address and is the world s no online payment service it s accepted on over million ebay t auctions and thousands and thousands of online shops you can also use paypal to pay your friends example it s a convenient way to split the phone bill with your roommate send cash to your kids in college or send cash to someone in another country better yet you can also earn while you do it each time someone signs up for an account and completes the refer a friend requirements we ll give you a bonus when you send money through pay pal you can fund your payments with your credit card or checking account you won t have

       " 'subject info you requested kcc thank you for your interest judgment coursesoffers an extensive training course in how to collect moneyjudgments if you are like many people you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact its now up to you to collect on the judgment the court does not require the loser to pay you the court will not even help you you must trace the loser down find their assets their employment bank accounts real estate stocks and bonds etc very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten in of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime the non payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions right now in the united states there is between and billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt for every judgment that is paid more judgments take its place we identified this massive market years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since we invented this business we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments the income potential is substantial in this profession we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making to over per year part time associates are earning between and per year some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves others build a sizable organization of to people in attractive business offices today our company and our associates have over million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing of this million million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates joint ventures are where we make our money we only break even when our course is purchased we make a margin on the reports we supply to our associates our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies police officers attorneys credit agencies etc all come to us for reports many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between million to over million dollars legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off the norm is interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments annual interest on million at translates to annually in interest income not counting the payment of the principal our associates earn half of this amount or per year this is just for interest not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income typically companies are sold for times earnings just based on simple interest an associate with million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately million dollars of all of our associates work out of their home are women and are part time one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go the judgments you are working on will be there when you return the judgments are still in force they do not disappear the way we train you is non confrontational you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing you never confront the debtor the debtor doesn t know who you are you are not a collection agency simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments we train you how to find out who to write to to of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help they call you you don t call them unless you want to you send them an agreement supplied in the course to sign which splits every dollar you collect to you and to them this applies no matter if the judgment is for or you then go on line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets we offer over powerful reports to assist you they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus to bank account locates employment locates skip traces and locating stocks and bonds etc the prices of our reports are very low typically to of what other firms charge for example we charge for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course when you receive the assets you keep and send to the original judgment holder once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court included in

       " 'subject unify sally fyi we ve had many complaints and i ve had many discussions today with dave n and inja they did discover some system board that is going to be replaced tonight hopefully replacing the board will do it but history makes me skeptical that this is the sole cause for the slow performance needless to say we had to get settlements and volume management to stop their work and we still didn t see any improvement i know everyone is just as frustrated as logistics at our last several meetings to discuss this problem i was insistent that unless they have an answer it seems to me and the rest of the staff that the system just cannot support the real heavy demand that first of month noms and the monthly close require i ve included an email i received from kathy kelly if you want some gory detail to save you the trouble it normally takes minutes to create nominations on the largest pipes today some have taken as long as minutes i ll keep you posted bob forwarded by robert superty hou ect on pm robert superty pm to inja chun hou ect ect dave nommensen hou ect ect cc subject unify fyi inja dave please read kathy s memo below don t know what to tell them we ve been down this road at the same time of the month over and over again any suggestions bob forwarded by robert superty hou ect on pm from katherine l kelly pm to robert superty hou ect ect cc edward terry hou ect ect subject unify bob you have probably already caught wind of this since it seems to be the only thing anyone is talking about today but i wanted to bring it to your attention that unify is at an all time pathetic slowness today basically this is all i ve heard about today from the schedulers clarissa has just handed me a screen print that shows that it took minutes to create a nom on tennessee robert has informed me that it has taken him minutes to create a nom on columbia gas it took me over minutes to log on today and as soon as i ran a report it kicked me out saying that i didn t have enough memory this has always been a problem at the end of the month but this month has reached in all time low i ve talked to dave about three or four times today and so has ed ed has been monitoring the system and he seems to think that client services has been taking a large part of the cpu time we have both questioned dave on this but he doesn t seem to see anything unusual with the amount of users from accounting although he does agree that a huge amount of cpu time is being used i hate to end this on a negative note but at this rate no one will be clean by tomorrow i don t know what the status is as far as people looking into ways to make unify faster but maybe it is time to draw some attention to this again by the way the bridge from sitara to unify has also been crawling today i ve already informed dave of this but the bridge was totally out of commission this past weekend as well this effected those people who tried to get a jump start on cleaning for the month and working on the first of the month noms i hate to say it but once again how can we expect people to get their work done if we don t give them systems that work on a good note i did get feedback from clarissa that terminal server was working well over the weekend unfortunately she said that unify was terribly slow but no slower than it is when she s here in the office',\n",

       " 'subject judicial judgements child support bgs you for your interest judgment courses offers an extensive training course in how to collect moneyjudgments if you are like many people you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact its now up to you to collect on the judgment the court does not require the loser to pay you the court will not even help you you must trace the loser down find their assets their employment bank accounts real estate stocks and bonds etc very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten in of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime the non payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions right now in the united states there is between and billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt for every judgment that is paid more judgments take its place we identified this massive market years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since we invented this business we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments the income potential is substantial in this profession we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making to over per year part time associates are earning between and per year some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves others build a sizable organization of to people in attractive business offices today our company and our associates have over million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing of this million million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates joint ventures are where we make our money we only break even when our course is purchased we make a margin on the reports we supply to our associates our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies police officers attorneys credit agencies etc all come to us for reports many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between million to over million dollars legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off the norm is interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments annual interest on million at translates to annually in interest income not counting the payment of the principal our associates earn half of this amount or per year this is just for interest not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income typically companies are sold for times earnings just based on simple interest an associate with million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately million dollars of all of our associates work out of their home are women and are part time one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go the judgments you are working on will be there when you return the judgments are still in force they do not disappear the way we train you is non confrontational you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing you never confront the debtor the debtor doesn t know who you are you are not a collection agency simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments we train you how to find out who to write to to of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help they call you you don t call them unless you want to you send them an agreement supplied in the course to sign which splits every dollar you collect to you and to them this applies no matter if the judgment is for or you then go on line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets we offer over powerful reports to assist you they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus to bank account locates employment locates skip traces and locating stocks and bonds etc the prices of our reports are very low typically to of what other firms charge for example we charge for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course when you receive the assets you keep and send to the original judgment holder once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court included in

resulting in a smoother skin surface we offer this patented material in both a tablet and a topical cream taken both internally and externally it is easy to understand how they can achieve such obvious results so quickly working from the inside out and from the outside in happy users report a healthy glow which they have never achieved with any other product product testimonials i ve been

though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried considering the fact that we have not met each other before but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day we have decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of this transaction as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you so we decided it is best using the e mail which is quicker and also to enable us meet up with the second quater payment for the year however let me start by introducing myself properly to you i am dr tom eke a director general in the department of petroleum resources d p r and i presently head the contract award panel incharge of contract awards and payment approvals i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence i and my colleagues are top officials of the federal government contract award panel our duties include evaluation vetting approval for payment of contract jobs done for the d p r e t c in order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds the source of this funds is as follows in the second quarter of this committee was mandated to review and award contracts to the tune of us million us dollars to a group of five firms for the supply construction and installation of oil pipe lines in warri and port harcourt during this process my colleagues and i decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately over inflate the total contract sum from us million to us million united states dollars with the main intention of sharing the remaining sum of us miilion amongst ourselves the federal government of nigeria has since the second quater of year approved the sum of us million for us as the contract sum and the sum of us million has also been paid to the foreign companies concerned as contract entitlements for the various contracts done but since the companies are entiltled to us million dollars only we are now left with us million dollars balance in the account which we intend to disburse amongst ourselves but by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel we cannot do this by ourselves as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau civil service laws from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names while still in government service making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our names right now i have therefore been delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of us million hence we are writing you this letter my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf you or your company will retain of the total amount us million while will be for us officials and the remaining will be used in offsetting all debts expenses and taxes incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer needless to say the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous in return we demand your complete honesty and trust you must however note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below a our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence b that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality c that you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your custody or any form of blackmail d that upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds

working days from the date of receipt of the necessary requirements from you we are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your total confidentiality in this transaction there is no cause for alarm i give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with us transactions like this have been successfully carried out in the past by most government executives here in my country there is great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant and the order of the day thus explaining why you might have heard stories of how money is been taken

legal their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instruction they are bound to make some mega bucks with only out of pocket cost print this now for your future reference if you would like to make at least every to months easily and comfortably please read the following then read it again and again follow the simple instruction below and your financial dreams will come true guaranteed instructions order all reports shown on the list below for each report send cash the name number of the report you are ordering and your e mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems when you place your order make sure you order each of the reports you will need all reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them your total cost x within a few days you will receive via e mail each of the reports from these different individuals save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the s of people who will order them from you also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer important do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their sequence on the list in any way other than what is instructed below in step through or you will loose out on the majority of your profits once you understand the way this works you will also see how it does not work if you change it remember this method has been tested and if you alter it it will not work people have tried to put their friends relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money but it does not work this way believe us some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you remember honesty reaps the reward this is a legitimate business you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time after you have ordered all reports take this advertisement and remove the name address of the person in report this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune move the name address in report down to report move the name address in report down to report move the name address in report down to report move the name address in report down to report insert your name address in the report position please make sure you copy every name address accurately this is critical to your success take this entire letter with the modified list of names and save it on your computer do not make any other changes save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data to assist you with marketing your business on the internet the reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more there are primary methods to get this venture going method by sending bulk e mail legally let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only e mails each let s also assume that the mailing receive only a of response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e mails instead of only each continuing with this example you send out only e mails with a response that is only orders for report those people responded by sending out e mail each for a total of out of those e mails only responded with orders that s people responded and ordered report those people mail out e mails each for a total of e mails the response to that is orders for report those people send e mail each for a total of million e mail sent out the response is orders for report those people send out e mails each for a total of million e mails the response to that is orders for report that s orders times each half a million dollars your total income in this example is grand total numbers do not lie get a pencil paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money remember friend this is assuming only people ordering out of you mailed to dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one th of those people mailed e mails each or more there are over million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming on line every day believe me many people will do just that and more method by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response we strongly suggest you start with method and add method as you go along for every you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report available reports the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each report by its number name only notes always send cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name and postal address

e mail is the sales tool of the future take advantage of this non commercialized method of advertising now the longer you wait the more savvy people will be taking your business using e mail get what is rightfully yours program yourself for success and dare to think big it sounds corny but it s true you ll never make it big if you don t have this belief system in place multi level marketing mlm has finally gained respectability it is being taught in the harvard business school and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between and of all goods and services will be sold through multi level methods this is a multi billion dollar industry and of the millionaires in the u s made their fortune in the last several years in mlm moreover statistics show people become millionaires everyday through multi level marketing you may have heard this story before but donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch without hesitating trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work the audience started to hoot and boo him he looked out at the audience and dead panned his response that s why i m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there with network marketing you have two sources of income direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business residual income is the secret of the wealthy it means investing time and money once and getting paid again and again and again in network marketing it also means getting paid for the work of others the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers fortunately sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it my name is jonathan rourke two years ago the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down sized and my position was eliminated after unproductive job interviews i decided to open my own business over the past year i incurred many unforeseen financial problems i owed my family friends and creditors over the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn t seem to make ends meet i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially in mid december i received this program via e mail six month s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities all of the programs i received in my opinion were not cost effective they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year it didn t tell me i d have to write a book to make it but like i was saying in december i received this program i didn t send for it or ask for it they just got my name off a mailing list thank goodness for that after reading it several times to make sure i was reading it correctly i couldn t believe my eyes here was a money making phenomenon i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out i would at least get my money back but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all so i checked it out with the u s post office hrs and they confirmed that it is indeed legal after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter i decided why not initially i sent out e mails it cost me about for my time on line the great thing about e mail is that i don t need any money for printing to send out the program and because all of my orders are filled via e mail the only expense is my time i am telling you like it is i hope it doesn t turn you off but i promised myself that i would not rip off anyone no matter how much money it cost me here is the basic version of what you need to do your first goal is to receive at least orders for report within weeks of your first program going out if you don t send out more programs until you do your second goal is to receive at least orders for report within weeks if not send out more programs until you do once you have your orders relax you ve met your goal you will make but keep at it if you don t get right off keep at it it may take some time for your down line to build keep at it stay focused and do not let yourself get distracted in less than one week i was starting to receive orders for report i kept at it kept mailing out the program and by january had received orders for report my first step in making in days was done by january had received orders for report more than i needed so i sat back and relaxed by march of my e mailing of i received with more coming in every day i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car please take time to read the attached program it will change your life forever remember it won t work if you don t try it this program does work but you must follow it exactly especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place it won t work you ll lose out on a lot of money in order for this program to work very fast try to meet your goal of orders for report and orders for report and you will make or more in days if you don t reach the first two goals with in four weeks relax you will still make a ton of money it may take a few months or so longer but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused that s the key i am living proof that it works if you choose not to participate in this program i am sorry it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you if you choose to participate follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was or you want to start your own business consider this a sign i did sincerely jonathan rourke p s do you have any idea what bills look like piled up on a kitchen table it s awesome a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports you should have concluded that such a program and one that is legal could not have been created by an amateur let me tell you a little about myself i had a profitable business for years then in my business began falling off i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me but it wasn t working finally i figured it out it wasn t me it was the economy inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since i don t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before the middle class was vanishing those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor as the saying goes the rich get richer and the poor get poorer the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to move up or get rich inflation will see to that you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with no risk and just a little bit of effort you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined follow the program exactly as instructed do not change it in any way it works exceedingly well as it is now remember to e mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of one of the people you send this to may send out and your name will be on everyone of them remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach so my friend i have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent it is up to you now think about it before you delete this program from your mailbox as i almost did take a little time to read it and really think about it get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money you will definitely get back what you invested any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in it works jody jacobs richmond va here s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar this method of raising capital really works every time i am sure that you could use up to or more in the next days before you say no way please read this program carefully this is not a chain letter but a perfectly legal money making opportunity basically this is what you do as with all multilevel businesses we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners and we offer a product for every dollar sent your orders come by mail and are filled by e mail so you are not involved in personal selling you do it privately in your own home store or office this is the greatest multi level mail order marketing anywhere this is what you must do order all reports shown on the list below you can t sell them if you don t have them for each report send cash the name number of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name return address in case of a problem make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems when you place your order make sure you order each of the five reports you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them within a few days you will receive via e mail each of the five reports save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the s of people who will order them from you important do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps a through g or you will lose out on the majority of your profits once you understand the way this works you ll also see how it doesn t work if you change it remember this method has been tested and if you alter it it will not work a look below for the listing of available reports b after you ve ordered the five reports take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their c move the name and address under report down to report d move the name and address under report down to report e move the name and address under report down to report f move the name and address under report down to report g insert your name and address in the report position please make sure you copy every name and address accurately copy and paste method works well take this entire letter including the modified list of names and save it to your computer make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter your cost to participate in this is practically nothing surely you can afford you obviously already have an internet connection and e mail is free to assist you with marketing your business on the internet the reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails where to find thousands of free classified ads and much much more here are two primary methods of building your downline method sending bulk e mail let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we ll assume you and all those involved send out only programs each let s also assume that the mailing receives a response using a good list the response could be much better also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of but continuing with this example you send out only programs with a response that is only orders for report those people respond by sending out programs each for a total of out of those people respond and order report those mail out programs each for a total of the response to that is orders for report those send out programs each for a total the response to that is i orders for report that amounts to each of bills for you in cash money then think about level five that s alone your total income in this example is for a total of remember friend this is assuming out of the people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out programs instead of believe me many people will do just that and more report will show you the best methods for bulk e mailing and e mail software method placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise let s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works assume your goal is to get only people to participate on your first level placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only downline members follow this example to achieve the staggering results below lst level your members with nd level members from those x rd level members from those x th level members from those x k th level members from those x k this totals remember friends this assumes that the people who participate only recruit people each think for a moment what would happen if they got people to participate most people get s of participants think about it for every you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can t advertise until they receive the report available reports order each report by number and name always send cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted always send your order via first class mail make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper so that the bill can t be seen against light on one of those sheets of paper include a the number name of the report

ar would be kept in sync with unify ar by the unify sap interface we believe that the business logic for that decision has changed and are now recommending that unify ar be permanently turned off and all ar functions be performed in sap i have briefly summarized the change in business situation below two years ago today netting allowed by legal and credit only if netting contract was already in place netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible regardless of existence of signed agreement netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time canada nets across counterparties netting performed in physical only financial settlements to maintain separate net statement process ena considering netting physical and financial together all account coordinators were to apply their own cash cash applied centrally in power financial and canada individual coordinators apply cash only in physical gas cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team although gas settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level this functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by financial settlements the company has not made any move towards calculating cost of funds by commercial team the account inquiry functionality in unify was thought to be a key on line tool old habits die hard most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing data rather than using the on line functionality overapplication of cash was not to be allowed overpayments would be classified as on account with issues tracked in a case management system case management system does not exist allowing overapplication helps the account coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account the counterparty legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the counterparty legal entity combination on the enron invoice given the number of legal entities enron has along with the number of entities our counterparties have this seems like a hopeless battle allowing cross application of cash seems easier corp required that intercompany settlements had to be settled with cash movement corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be settled with cash movement converting to sap ar simplifies the unify sap interface in the following ways bank deposits into sap do not have to be split off into unify cash entries in unify do not have to be interfaced back to sap unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to sap payables information does not have to be interfaced from sap to unify given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face two problems in unify controls built into unify are already obsolete unify does not maintain all products in one database making efforts to net across products in the future physical with financial for instance impossible our understanding of the netting process in sap indicates that there are no controls which sounds good at this point and that we would retain the automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable within sap however we emphasize that netting would be done in sap not at the time of finaling a payment in unify to repeat we are recommending that unify ar be turned off and we convert to sap ar we will

       " 'subject reduction in road accidents august dear sir madam in case you have received this mail earlier kindly ignore this mail it may have been re sent to you by mistake ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody we have devised a set of systems which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than seventy five percent we have already filed and are in process of filing further multiple and appropriate disclosure documents provisional patent applications at the united states patent trademarks office uspto and also applications under the patent co operation treaty at world intellectual property organization wipo at geneva there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative moreover we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing minimizing human suffering to a very large extent there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings statistics advantages options economics we are looking for the followings business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds one person mildly injured every three seconds c current yearly automobile sales worldwide more than billion us d number of automobiles worldwide more than billion pieces e daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide more than billion us per day of the worldwide gross national product of more than billion us more than us per year more than billion us per day theadvantages of the technology developed by us a the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto insurance this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles accordingly the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction additionally because of saving of lives the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially b as per the who studies and projections road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today it is projected by who that by the year they will occupy the number three positions next only to heart disease and depression by introduction of this technology we are sure that this will not happen on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death in the year at all c this technology will therefore make all vehicles cheaper and safer not only will the cost be reduced safety which is priceless in itself will also be greatly enhanced as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted the life of the patent will be years even at the current levels with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death there is a daily loss of two billion us even at the present level over a period of twenty years without any interest and without any compounding this loss works out to be billion us x days x years billion us d our technology will ensure that at least seventy five percent of the above losses are prevented such figure works out to be more that billion us it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level as per the future projections the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase hence the figure is likely to be increase very substantially in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further e at the current levels more than million persons are dying every year due to road accidents even at the current rates more than million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years i e life of the patent when granted besides at the current levels million people are injured every year in the next twenty years the number of people injured due to road accident will therefore be more than half a billion f if we add to that the personal physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings are all unmeasurable in quantities presently known to human kind g considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind h the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that in the very near future the use of this technology will become unavoidable it should and will become mandatory by law to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future i as described hereinabove this technology and its utility are incomparable outthought of and unheard of till date it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures in future it can and will be applied to other mode of transport like aircrafts and trains also among other things we have the following options available to us options available to us a outright sale a immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration b further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications before taking steps as outlined in a the process b will obviously increase the realization in terms of price b licencing options i new vehicles granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles individually or collectively all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis ii conversion of existing vehicles to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than billion vehicles all over the world c combined options a collaborative arrangement with some private and or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre decided sharing partnership arrangement the economics of the project will be as follows in case any all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs the cost escalation may not be more than to and the safety and the protection will be ten times more than the price escalation hence drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation in case the existing vehicles are modified the cost involved will be approximately to of the value of the vehicle but partial modifications at a lower cost which will give partial protection may also be carried out as a thumb rule the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective there are more than billion motor vehicles in the world at present besides there are an unspecified number of non motorized ehicles almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from among the motorised vehicles the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out but over all some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of us per vehicle the conversion industry works out to be worth billion us realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date as pointed hereinabove the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to in the range of billion us per year over the next three years alternatively considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition for such conversion licenses can be granted on line on receipt of on line payments in that case different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle in case licensing is done the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end user as per his circumstances and needs however piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and or estimate p s some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point more details including website references are

data along with other available date to generate a price for credit the price will be published externally likely for a fee and as a free service via the web or via automated processes option appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to date data as possible stuart is working with the credit team to define additional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely what we are looking for alternatively if it is possible to obtain the actual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to generate our own score in addition to d b s we will need the global failure score as well currently we are active in europe as well as the us and expect to move towards asia and austrailia over time hopefully this data is available via d b connect another consideration is the term of contract we would likely prefer a longer term contract so that if they decide they don t like what we are doing with the data we cannot be cut off does it make sense from your perspective to approach d b to be our long term strategic providor of customer data this would likely make their deal maker look good in his boss s eyes give you lot s of negotiating ability and give a us the long term preferential contract that we are looking for let s discuss further bryan mary solmonson to john sherriff lon ect ect bryan seyfried lon ect ect cc philippe a bibi hou ect ect sally beck hou ect ect stuart ffoulkes lon ect ect subject dun bradstreet info for credit trading i have received preliminary information from d b i think several issues questions have been raised that if explored could result in a better solution for the money option the update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to monthly for a cost of usd through march option i wasn t sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in if you are particularly interested in the financial stress score and credit score for example there are multiple alternatives a keep quartlery refresh of base data party name etc and refresh scores that are added changed on a monthly basis cost usd per record note that there are records in the file currently with financial and credit scores making this potentially a very expensive alternative x b batch or ftp updates of the financial and stress scores can only be provided monthly d b is working on a solution that would provide a weekly update to their customers in a batch or ftp manner but has not committed to when this will be ready therefore if more timely updates than monthly are desired it is also possible to transactionally access records one at a time using d b s software the cost for this is extremely high at usd per score option d b connect product d b connect is a tool set of matching software an externally validated reference file credit and marketing information and d b services that enables the most effective integration of customer information and third party information with d b information only this type of process and information integration capability can facilitate and ensure accurate identification linkage and maintenance of your customer s complete relationship in addition d b connect assures organizations of referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to d b so that the most recent d b information is always transmitted to your organization and updated within your local d b connect reference file d b connect is scalable cost typically ranging from customer access module cam batch cam online full information integrator data with more specifics as to your needs this option should perhaps be pursued questions issues d b had questions regarding the use of their data and whether enron customers would be offered this information for a fee or free i explained that i did not feel the data would be offered directly to enron customers but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available externally via web site etc all pricing above is based upon this understanding if i have not portrayed the usage correctly it will be imperative to get a better understanding before final pricing can be negotiated are there specific data elements that you are interested in alternatives may vary by data element financial stress score and credit score reference above were explored as an example what is timeframe for needing a solution financial stress score and credit score are only available on u s companies a comparable measure global failure score the liklihood of default or bankruptcy is available for international companies this rating score however is not currently available via a batch or ftp manner this could result in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this score in a batch manner pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes this is probably negotiable as the data is the same the thought process is that if the repository is used for credit or risk decisions d b will see decreased usage and revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments if you would like me to follow up

legal their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions they are bound to make some

profitable opportunity i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required to my astonishment i received a total in weeks with money still coming in pam hedland fort lee new jersey another said this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it

next months after that i made a total of so far in the past months by re entering the program i have made over and i am playing it again the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything more testimonials later but first print this now for your future reference if you would like to make at least every to months easily and comfortably please read the following then read it again and again follow the simple instruction below and your financial dreams will come true guaranteed instructions order all reports shown on the list below for each report

left corner in case of any mail problems when you place your order make sure you order each of the reports you will need all reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them your

thinking they could get all the money but it does not work this way believe us some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you remember honesty reaps the reward this is a legitimate business you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time after you have ordered all reports take this advertisement and remove the name address of the person in report this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune move the name address in report down to report move the name address in report down to report move the name address in report down to report move the name address in report down to report insert your name address in the report position please make sure you copy every name address accurately this is critical to your success take this entire letter with the modified list of names and save it on your computer do not make any other changes save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data to assist you with marketing your business on the internet the reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more there are primary methods to get this venture going method by sending bulk e mail legally let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only e mails each let s also assume that the mailing receives only a of response the response could be much better but let s just say it is only also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e mails instead of only each continuing with this example you send out only e mails with a response that is only orders for report those people responded by sending out e mails each for a total of out of those e mails only responded with orders that s people who responded and ordered report those people mail out e mails each for a total of e mails the response to that is orders for report those people send e mails each for a total of million e mails sent out the response is orders for report those people send out e mails each for a total of million e mails the response to that is orders for report that s orders times each half a million dollars your total income in this example is grand total numbers do not lie get a pencil paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money remember friend this is assuming only people ordering out of you mailed to dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one th of those people mailed e mails each or more there are over million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day believe me many people will do just that and more method by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response we strongly suggest you start with method and add method as you go along for every you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report available reports the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each report by its number name only notes always send cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the report you are ordering your e mail address and
